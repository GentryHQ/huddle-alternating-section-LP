## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS



### What I learned

- I really enjoined working on this project with SCSS, this is my second project working with it and I feel myself improving.

- I learnt the proper way to use media queries with SASS. In my previous project (my first project) with SASS, styles at media queries were not working without the use of ```!important```. In the project, I was able to fix that.




### Useful resources

- Stack OverFlow - Can't actually find a link. In one of the answers, I got an insight as to why my media queries are not working without ```!important```
